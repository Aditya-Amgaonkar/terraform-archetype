# localstack environment

## Description
This terraform workflow is used for creating the local enviromnet for development amd testng. [Localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) is a mechanism by which you can mimic the major cloud provider environments on yor local machine.

## Prerequisites
* [Install Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Install pip3 (usually it should be auto installed when Python3 is installed)
* Install localstack
  <br>`pip3 install localstack`
  <br> Note: Also, check prerequisites of localstack [here](https://github.com/localstack/localstack#requirements-for-developing-or-starting-locally)
* [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* 

## Environment components (Obviously all are on localstack)
* AWS VPC
* AWS Subnet
* AWS EC2

## steps to run

### To create the environment:
* terraform init
* terraform plan
* terraform apply (you will be prompted to "Enter a value:", just enter "yes")

### To destroy the environment:
* terraform destroy (you will be prompted to "Enter a value:", just enter "yes")

## Caution
Do not delete the autogenerated files by terraform i.e. 'terraform.tfstate' and 'terraform.tfstate.backup'. Deleting these files will lead to Terraform being out of sync.
